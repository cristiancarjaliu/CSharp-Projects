This C# console application generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player tries to guess it. After each guess, the program gives feedback, indicating whether the guessed number is too high or too low. The game continues until the player correctly guesses the number or decides to exit by typing one of the predefined keywords: "exit", "ex", or "stop". It's a fun and simple way to practice loops, input validation, and random number generation in C#.
