This C# console application prompts the user to enter a sentence starting with "Hello" and processes the input to analyze its structure. It checks whether the sentence starts with "Hello," transforms the input into CamelCase format, and counts the total number of characters, words, and letters. The program includes input validation to ensure that the entered sentence is not empty or solely composed of spaces. Users can exit the application at any time by typing predefined keywords: "exit," "ex," or "stop." This program serves as an engaging way to practice string manipulation, input validation, and control flow in C#.
